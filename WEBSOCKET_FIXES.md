# WebSocket Issues Fixed

## 🔍 **Issues Identified and Resolved**

### **1. Duplicate WebSocket Connections**
**Problem**: Multiple WebSocket connections were being created due to:
- React Strict Mode causing double mounting in development
- Multiple WebSocketProvider instances (global + page-specific)
- Improper connection cleanup when tokens changed

**Solution**:
- ✅ Fixed connection reuse logic to only reuse stable connections
- ✅ Removed duplicate WebSocketProvider from dev page
- ✅ Added proper connection cleanup with delays to prevent race conditions
- ✅ Improved token-based connection management

### **2. Real-time Messaging Not Working**
**Problem**: Message type mismatches between client and server:
- Client sent `type: 'private_message'` but server expected constants
- Server sent `MessageTypePrivateMessageAck` but client expected `'private_message_ack'`
- Inconsistent message type handling

**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated server to handle both string literals and constants
- ✅ Fixed all message type constants to use string literals
- ✅ Standardized message types across client and server
- ✅ Added better logging for message debugging

### **3. Connected People Not Working in Sidebar**
**Problem**: User list broadcasting issues:
- Server sent `MessageTypeUserList` but client expected `'user_list'`
- User list only broadcast on connect/disconnect, not periodically
- Missing user list updates

**Solution**:
- ✅ Fixed user list message type to use string literal `'user_list'`
- ✅ Added periodic user list broadcasting every 30 seconds
- ✅ Improved user list logging and debugging
- ✅ Enhanced connection status handling

## 🛠️ **Files Modified**

### **Client Side**:
1. `/client/src/lib/hooks/useWebSockets.ts`
   - Fixed duplicate connection prevention
   - Improved connection reuse logic
   - Added better heartbeat logging

2. `/client/src/context/webSocketProvider.tsx`
   - Enhanced token validation
   - Improved connection condition logic

3. `/client/src/app/(pages)/dev/websockets.tsx`
   - Removed duplicate WebSocketProvider
   - Now uses global provider from Providers.tsx

### **Server Side**:
1. `/server/websockets/client.go`
   - Fixed message type handling to support both strings and constants
   - Standardized all message types to use string literals
   - Added better error handling and logging

2. `/server/websockets/hub.go`
   - Fixed welcome message type
   - Added periodic user list broadcasting
   - Improved connection monitoring

3. `/server/websockets/broadcast.go`
   - Fixed user list message type
   - Added better logging for broadcasts

4. `/server/websockets/group.go`
   - Fixed group notification message types
   - Standardized all group-related messages

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **1. Test Duplicate Connection Prevention**
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Filter by "WS" (WebSocket)
3. Navigate between pages
4. **Expected**: Only one WebSocket connection should be visible
5. **Expected**: No duplicate connections in DevTools

### **2. Test Real-time Messaging**
1. Open two browser windows/tabs with different users
2. Send a message from User A to User B
3. **Expected**: Message appears instantly in User B's chat
4. **Expected**: User A receives acknowledgment
5. **Expected**: No duplicate messages

### **3. Test Connected People Display**
1. Open sidebar on the right
2. Have multiple users log in simultaneously
3. **Expected**: Online users appear in sidebar within 30 seconds
4. **Expected**: User count updates when users connect/disconnect
5. **Expected**: Green dots indicate online status

### **4. Test WebSocket Connection Stability**
1. Monitor browser console for WebSocket logs
2. **Expected**: See "🔌 WebSocket connected successfully"
3. **Expected**: See periodic "🔌 Sending heartbeat ping"
4. **Expected**: No connection errors or duplicate connections

## 🔧 **Debugging Tips**

### **Client-side Debugging**:
- Check browser console for `🔌` prefixed logs
- Monitor Network tab for WebSocket connections
- Look for message type mismatches in console

### **Server-side Debugging**:
- Check server logs for WebSocket connection events
- Monitor user list broadcasts: "Periodic user list broadcast"
- Watch for message type handling: "Received WebSocket message"

### **Common Issues to Watch**:
1. **Token Expiry**: WebSocket tokens expire every 30 seconds
2. **Connection Drops**: Network issues may cause reconnections
3. **Message Delays**: First message after connection may be delayed

## 📊 **Performance Improvements**

- ✅ Reduced duplicate connections (better resource usage)
- ✅ Faster message delivery (fixed type mismatches)
- ✅ More reliable user presence (periodic updates)
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Improved connection stability

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Monitor in Production**: Watch for connection stability
2. **User Feedback**: Test with multiple concurrent users
3. **Performance Metrics**: Monitor WebSocket connection counts
4. **Error Tracking**: Set up alerts for WebSocket errors

---

**Note**: These fixes address the core WebSocket issues. The system should now have:
- ✅ Single WebSocket connection per user
- ✅ Real-time messaging working properly
- ✅ Connected people displaying correctly
- ✅ Better error handling and debugging
